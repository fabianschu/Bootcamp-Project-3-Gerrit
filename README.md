<h1>Gerrit â€“ Chat with people nearby!</h1>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/fabianschu">Fabian Scherer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/arews">Are W. Sandvik</a>, and I, <a href="https://github.com/noamrubin22/">Noam Rubin</a>, did this  
as our final project as web development students at Ironhack Berlin.

We wanted to use everything we've learned so far, and create something that would be fun to use. Pierre Portal showed us this <a href="https://github.com/pierreportal/socket-io-lecture-for-ironhack/tree/master/models">cool and very light weight framework 
for implementing messaging</a>, so we decided to build a chat platform with pre defined chatrooms that are only open to users in the same approximate geo location. In other words: It lets you chat to randoms close by.
</p>

<h2>Technology used</h2>
<p>
On top of the DOM, we use React.js as our main framework. We also use the Mapbox GL JS library for map functionality, and Socket.io for the messaging.

We use Node.js for packet management, and the Express framework for programming the server side of the application.

For the database we use MongoDB.
